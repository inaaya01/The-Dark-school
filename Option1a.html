                <p><strong>You enter the back room, following the water. You enter the room in pure darkness. You reach out to try and find the light switch. You suddenly trip, as soon as you turn the light on. You look down and see nothing on the ground. You look around and bend down, once you look up that's it. You see your life flash before your eyes, never seeing light againâ€¦  </strong></p>
