                <p><strong>You tell the principal what happened, she doesnâ€™t believe you. You ask her to come back later at night when the school is closed to check it out. She agrees. She later comes to the school and while your partner is cleaning you take her to the room. She goes in, you turn on the lights, you look around for a while, she sees nothing and gets mad for wasting her time. Just as she was about to fire you a creature jumps out and your life flashes before you eyes, you both die.</strong></p>
