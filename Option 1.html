                <p><strong>As you approach the room you hear weird noises, but you still go in anyway you start cleaning and put your bucket of tools down on a desk. You start brooming the room and you turn around to get your cleaning supplies and see that your bucket is gone. You see drops of water leading to the back room in the room.</strong></p>
