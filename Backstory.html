                <p><strong>You are a janitor at Northwood high, you are cleaning up the school after everyone has left. The school is a mess, highschoolers don’t care about anything and leave a huge mess. You are stuck in the school till you clean everything up and it’s already 10:00 pm. You're almost done, one room left. They call that room the room of horror. The room is called the room of horror because strange and mysterious things happen there, clocks randomly fall, computers break, and legend has it some people have died. Usually your partner would clean that room but is sick, so you have to take his place. </strong></p>
